Maine's Governor Paul LePage will head to the nation’s capital to testify against the creation of national monuments by the president without state approval.LePage believes Obama violated the Antiquities Act when he approved the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument.Zinke says he'll provide a preliminary review with recommendations in 45 days.\n",

He just wants them to be nice to him. But that's not their job,\" Earnest said Tuesday during a Harvard University John. F. Kennedy School of Government forum on the press and the presidency.Earnest said a stark difference between Trump and Democratic former President Barack Obama is Obama relished the opportunity to marshal facts to make an argument.In contrast, when Trump is under pressure, Earnest said, his instinct is to create a distraction. He said that's what Trump did by accusing Obama of wiretapping his campaign while offering no proof.Earnest said no president has the authority to unilaterally wiretap someone.Earnest said one reaction he's seen to the Trump presidency is a renewed interest in newspapers, television news and other news outlets.He also said that the election of Trump is a reminder that elections matter - a message he said he sometimes had trouble impressing on younger voters.\n",

      "\"Somehow, I think I'm going to have a little easier time making that case before the next election,\" he said.He said one of the biggest changes he has seen in the relationship between the White House and the press corps is new technology. He said cellphones combined with social media platforms puts intense pressure on reporters to push out every new tidbit of information instantly.Despite the online technology, Earnest said, he still believes it's important to have a daily White House press briefing to let reporters press the administration on the issues of the day.\"There's something that's symbolically important about the briefing - the idea that there is a senior member of the White House staff who the president designates as the person who will every day prepare himself or herself to go out and speak on camera, on the record, and answer any question that any journalist can come up with,\" he said.Earnest was White House press secretary under Obama from 2014 until Trump took office in January.\n",

      "\"President Kennedy called on a new generation of Americans to give their talents to the service of the country,\" Kennedy's daughter, Caroline Kennedy, said in a statement. \"With exceptional dignity and courage, President Obama has carried that torch into our own time, providing young people of all backgrounds with an example they can emulate in their own lives.\" Caroline Kennedy and her son, Jack Schlossberg, will present Obama with the award May 7 at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston. \"Humbled to be recognized by a family with a legacy of service,\" Obama said in his official Twitter account. The award is presented annually by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation to public servants who have made courageous decisions of conscience without regard for the personal or professional consequences. It is named for Kennedy's 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \"Profiles in Courage.\" The book tells the stories of eight U.S. senators who risked their careers by taking principled stands for unpopular positions. \"Faced with unrelenting political opposition, President Obama has embodied the definition of courage that my grandfather cites in the opening lines of 'Profiles in Courage': grace under pressure,\" Schlossberg said. \"Throughout his two terms in office, he represented all Americans with decency, integrity, and an unshakeable commitment to the greater good.\" Obama is being recognized for \"his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage in a new century,\" the foundation said, citing the expansion of health care options for millions, restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba and leadership on an international climate change agreement. The award has been given out annually since 1989. Last year's winner was Democratic Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy. Obama is the third former U.S. president to earn the award, joining Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush. Other winners include U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., former Ukraine President Victor Yushchenko and former U.S. Rep. Carl Elliott Sr., D-Ala.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama firmly defended his decision to cut nearly three decades off convicted leaker Chelsea Manning's prison term Wednesday, arguing in his final White House news conference that the former Army intelligence analyst had served a \"tough prison sentence\" already.\n",

      "Taking questions on many topics two days before his presidency ends, Obama also warned that the \"moment may be passing\" for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, pushing back on criticism over his recent move to put pressure on the Jewish state over settlement-building. Turning his attention to President-elect Donald Trump, Obama said he reserves the right to speak out as ex-president if Trump violates America's \"core values.\"Obama said he granted clemency to Manning because she had gone to trial, taken responsibility for her crime and received a sentence that was harsher than other leakers had received. He emphasized that he had merely commuted her sentence, not granted a pardon, which would have symbolically forgiven her for the crime.\"I feel very comfortable that justice has been served,\" Obama said.Manning was convicted in 2013 of violating the Espionage Act and other crimes for leaking more than 700,000 classified documents while working as an intelligence analyst in Baghdad. Formerly known as Bradley Manning, she declared as transgender after being sentenced to 35 years in prison. She had served more than six years before Obama commuted her sentence on Tuesday, with a release date set for May.\"The notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital, classified information would think that it goes unpunished, I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served,\" Obama said.Obama's defense of controversial decisions came as he prepares to exit the presidency after eight years marked by major victories on health care, the economy and climate change, along with disappointments over his inability to achieve his goals on immigration, gun control and closing the Guantanamo Bay prison. He also wound down wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but wrestled with other security threats posed by the Islamic State group and the Syria civil war he was unable to resolve.Even many of Obama's proudest achievements, like the \"Obamacare\" health care overhaul, stand to be rolled back or undermined by President-elect Donald Trump, a shadow that hangs over Obama's legacy as he leaves office. The formal end comes Friday when Obama and Trump will motorcade together to the Capitol for Trump's swearing-in before Obama, then an ex-president, flies with his family to California for a vacation.Reflecting on his legacy as the first black president, Obama disputed the notion that race relations had worsened. And he dismissed as \"fake news\" the idea that there is widespread voter fraud in the U.S., a notion that Democrats say is used to justify restrictions that make it harder for African-Americans to vote.Appearing one last time in front of the White House seal, Obama said he was \"significantly worried\" that the growth of Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories would \"increasingly make a two-state solution impossible.\" He stood behind his decision to allow a U.N. Security Council resolution to pass criticizing Israel over the settlements, though he conceded Trump might pursue a different approach.\"If you do not have two states, then in some form or fashion you are extending an occupation,\" Obama said.He defended his administration's rapprochement with Cuba and his eleventh-hour move to end the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy that lets any Cuban who makes it to U.S. soil stay and become a legal resident. Ending the visa-free path was the latest development in a warming of relations that has included the easing of the U.S. economic embargo and the restoration of commercial flights between the U.S. and the small island nation.\"That was a carry-over of an old way of thinking that didn't make sense in this day and age, particularly as we're opening up travel between the two countries,\" Obama said of the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy.After leaving office, Obama plans to write a book, raise money to develop his presidential library, and work on a Democratic initiative to prepare for the 2020 round of congressional redistricting. Yet he said he plans to assume a low profile in the months after he leaves office, and to avoid commenting on politics on a daily basis.\"I want to be quiet a little bit, and not hear myself talk so darn much,\" Obama said.Yet he carved out room for potential exceptions. Obama was insistent that he wouldn't stay silent of Trump tried to deport children brought to the U.S. illegally, a group Obama has sought to protect though executive action.\"That would merit me speaking out,\" Obama said.Although Obama had long intended to take one last round of questions before leaving office, White House officials said that in recent days, Obama became intent on using the occasion to draw a symbolic contrast with Trump on issues of accountability and press freedoms. Trump's team has said it's considering changes to the traditional daily press briefing and to the location of news conferences, stoking concerns among journalists that their ability to cover the presidency may be scaled back.Obama alluded to those concerns in his opening remarks, noting the role the press plays in American democracy.\"It doesn't work if we don't have a well-informed citizenry, and you are the conduit,\" Obama said.\n",

      "Jan 20, 2009Dear Barack,Congratulations on becoming our President. You have just begun a fantastic chapter in your life.Very few have had the honor of knowing the responsibility you now feel. Very few know the excitement of the moment and the challenges you will face.There will be trying moments. The critics will rage. Your “friends” will disappoint you. But, you will have an Almighty God to comfort you, a family who loves you, and a country that is pulling for you, including me. No matter what comes, you will be inspired by the character and compassion of the people you now lead.God bless you.Sincerely,[GW]The letter from Clinton to Bush also extols the thrills of the presidency.President Bill Clinton's letter to President-elect George W. Bush in 2001.January 20, 2001Dear George,Today you embark on the greatest venture, with the greatest honor, that can come to an American citizen.Like me, you are especially fortunate to lead our country in a time of profound and largely positive change, when old questions, not just about the role of government, but about the very nature of our nation, must be answered anew.You lead a proud, decent, good people. And from this day you are President of all of us. I salute you and wish you success and much happiness.The burdens you now shoulder are great but often exaggerated. The sheer joy of doing what you believe is right is inexpressible.My prayers are with you and your family. Godspeed.Sincerely, Bill\n",

To show you the Lincoln Bedroom, and the bedrooms that were once ours, to introduce you to all the people—the florists, the grounds-keepers and the butlers—who dedicate themselves to making this historic house a home. The four of us wandered the majestic halls of the house you had no choice but to move in to. When you slid down the banister of the solarium, just as we had done as 8-year-olds and again as 20-year-olds chasing our youth, your joy and laughter were contagious.Those banister-sliding photos were part of the mix, and the joy is indeed infectious: \n",

The trio begin their stroll in the Cross Hall, and meander through the South Portico side of the first floor, then to the East Room, Green Room, Blue Room and Red Room, White House photographer Pete Souza also took to his Instagram account Wednesday, posting a photo of the president giving his final press conference before leaving office. In the photo, Obama is seen waving to the pool of reporters. \"Waving goodbye at the conclusion of his last press conference as President earlier today,\" Souza wrote. \n",

      "WASHINGTON — Vouching for the successor he never imagined having, President Barack Obama on Monday sought to reassure an anxious nation and world that Donald Trump would maintain America's alliances and its status as the \"indispensable nation.\" He credited the president-elect for tapping into American voters' anxiety and enthusiasm.\"Do I have concerns?\" Obama added. \"Absolutely.\"Speaking at a White House news conference before a three-nation trip that was supposed to be his grand valedictory tour, Obama pointedly refused to criticize Trump, who only a week ago Obama said was \"woefully unprepared for the job\" and couldn't \"handle the nuclear codes.\"Instead, Obama did his best to soothe the pangs of uncertainty at home and abroad after a divisive campaign that included charges of racism, sexism and other offensive rhetoric, and questions from Trump about the validity of the United States' security relationships in Europe and Asia.\"There is enormous continuity ... that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order around the world,\" Obama said. Relationships and policies go beyond presidents, he said, adding that military officials, diplomats and intelligence officers would cooperate with their foreign counterparts as before.In his White House meeting with Trump last week, Obama said the Republican \"expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,\" including \"strong and robust NATO\" partnerships.It was a sharp change in tone for Obama, who regularly mocked Trump's candidacy in the last days before the election, even accusing the billionaire businessman and former reality television star of helping the Islamic State group with his rhetoric about Muslims and undermining U.S. democracy through his claims of a \"rigged\" election. At the time, almost all polls showed Democrat Hillary Clinton leading Trump.Asked about one of Trump's most contentious moves since his triumph, appointing Steve Bannon as chief strategist and senior adviser, Obama said it was up to the president-elect to appoint a team that will serve him well.\"It takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality,\" Obama said of the choice of Bannon, a man celebrated by the white nationalist movement. Of Trump, Obama said \"it's important for us to let him make his decisions.\" But adding a hint of worry, Obama said he counseled Trump during their White House meeting: \"It's really important to send some signals of unity.\"Whereas Obama hailed Trump's \"impressive\" ability to speak to voters, he also delivered a subtle critique of Clinton's campaign.He said Democrats must broaden their focus beyond just swing states after an election that left the Senate and House in Republican hands, as well as most of the nation's governor's mansions. He rejected the idea that demographic advantages would lead to all-but-assured victories for the party, saying it must rebuild at the local, state and national levels.\"We're going to have to compete everywhere,\" he said, reflecting on his own 2008 win in Iowa, a state that went for Trump this time. \"We're going to have to show up everywhere.\"Clinton kept a relatively light campaign schedule until the final weeks of her campaign, mostly attending smaller events in battleground states. Her campaign focused heavily on motivating the Democratic base of women and minority voters, rather than swaying independents. \"Good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them,\" Obama said.While Obama is in Germany, Greece and Peru, he said his team would accelerate efforts to ensure a smooth transition to the Trump administration.He stressed that he would try to strengthen the American economy over his final two months, so that \"when we turn over the keys, the car's in pretty good shape.\"\n",

      "The White House said Obama called the Republican in the early hours of the morning to congratulate him on his victory in the presidential campaign, which marked a forceful rebuke by voters to Obama's eight years in office. The two leaders planned to meet Thursday at the White House, where Obama was to update Trump about ongoing planning for the transition.Obama was to offer his first reaction to the election later Wednesday in a televised statement that the White House said would focus on \"what steps we can take as a country to come together after this hard-fought election season.\"\"Ensuring a smooth transition of power is one of the top priorities the president identified at the beginning of the year and a meeting with the president-elect is the next step,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement.For Obama, the act of holding the meeting is a humbling blow to Obama's legacy and hopes for leaving a lasting imprint on the nation's policies. Trump has vowed to rip up much of what Obama accomplished, including his signature health care law, the Iran nuclear deal and a painstakingly negotiated trade deal with Asia.Obama also called Hillary Clinton after it became clear she'd lost the race. The White House said Obama had \"expressed admiration for the strong campaign she waged throughout the country.\"It was unclear how substantive Obama's call was with Trump, or how long it lasted, although the White House noted that Obama placed the call from his residence in the White House, rather than from the West Wing. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, described it as a \"very nice talk.\" She said Trump had missed the president's original call as Trump as speaking to supporters in New York, then called him back after leaving the stage.Like Clinton and other Democrats, Obama didn't appear to see Trump's victory coming. As he campaigned vigorously for Clinton in the race's final days, Obama said he was confident that if Americans showed up to vote, they'd choose against electing the billionaire reality TV show with no formal government experience.He had also warned supporters in apocalyptic terms that \"the fate of the republic\" rested on Clinton defeating Trump on Election Day.\n",

The two leaders planned to meet Thursday at the White House, where Obama was to update Trump about ongoing planning for the transition.Obama was to offer his first reaction to the election later Wednesday in a televised statement that the White House said would focus on \"what steps we can take as a country to come together after this hard-fought election season.\"\"Ensuring a smooth transition of power is one of the top priorities the president identified at the beginning of the year and a meeting with the president-elect is the next step,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement.For Obama, the act of holding the meeting is a humbling blow to Obama's legacy and hopes for leaving a lasting imprint on the nation's policies. Trump has vowed to rip up much of what Obama accomplished, including his signature health care law, the Iran nuclear deal and a painstakingly negotiated trade deal with Asia.Obama also called Hillary Clinton after it became clear she'd lost the race. The White House said Obama had \"expressed admiration for the strong campaign she waged throughout the country.\"It was unclear how substantive Obama's call was with Trump, or how long it lasted, although the White House noted that Obama placed the call from his residence in the White House, rather than from the West Wing. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, described it as a \"very nice talk.\" She said Trump had missed the president's original call as Trump as speaking to supporters in New York, then called him back after leaving the stage.Like Clinton and other Democrats, Obama didn't appear to see Trump's victory coming. As he campaigned vigorously for Clinton in the race's final days, Obama said he was confident that if Americans showed up to vote, they'd choose against electing the billionaire reality TV show with no formal government experience.He had also warned supporters in apocalyptic terms that \"the fate of the republic\" rested on Clinton defeating Trump on Election Day.\n",

      "\n",
      "PHILADELPHIA — In the place where America's democracy took root, with tens of thousands shivering in the cold, Barack and Michelle Obama passed the torch Monday to Hillary Clinton in an emotional but anxious plea to elect her president.Though the book won't close on his presidency until Inauguration Day, Obama's frenzied, last-minute push for Clinton was a farewell tour of the nation. As he crisscrossed Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, he waxed nostalgic, told old stories and teared up as he thanked the nation for betting, improbably, on \"a skinny guy with a funny name.\"He said he'd been asked recently whether the hope that defined his campaign had somehow survived eight trying years.\"The answer's yes,\" Obama said in Independence Mall, not far from the Liberty Bell. He said he was still a believer, \"and that's because of you.\"\"In the letters you've written me, in the tears you've shed for a lost loved one, I've seen again and again your goodness and your strength and your heart,\" Obama said.Then the Obamas and the Clintons embraced onstage: The last Democratic president and the current one; the first black president and the woman who, on Tuesday, may break yet another historic barrier.It was left to Michelle Obama, whose visceral speeches this campaign hit a nerve with many Americans, to cast both families as part of a singular American story: One of inclusive opportunity that she hoped would contrast powerfully with the vision of Republican Donald Trump.She said she marveled at a country where \"a girl like me from the South Side of Chicago, whose great-great-grandfather was a slave, can go to some of the finest universities on earth. Where the biracial son of a single mother from Hawaii and the son of a single mother from Hope, Arkansas, can both make it to the White House.\"\"Thank you for welcoming us into your communities, for giving us a chance whether you agreed with our politics or not,\" Mrs. Obama said, in her own send-off to the nation. She said ensuring Clinton wins the election was \"perhaps the last and most important thing that I can do for my country as first lady.\"It wasn't always this way. In 2008, when Obama defeated Clinton in a grinding primary, there was naked bitterness between the two Democrats that only began to soften when Obama named her secretary of state.Nearly a decade later, the Obamas need Clinton as much as she needs them, to prevent their legacy from being eviscerated by a victorious Trump. After all, the president told supporters earlier in Ann Arbor, Michigan, all his accomplishments \"go out the window if we don't win tomorrow.\"Clinton, too, was meditative about the bruising battles that have led her to this moment.\"I regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became,\" Clinton said, without naming Trump. In a less-than-subtle display of political symbolism, she spoke from behind the presidential seal affixed to the podium from which Obama introduced her.The Obamas are keenly aware that whether or not Clinton wins Tuesday, their era is coming to an end, a reality punctuated by both Obamas' insistence that neither will ever run for office again.So in a parting gift to Clinton, Obama offered her his campaign mantra - \"Fired up, ready to go\" - and told rally-goers in New Hampshire how it had been coined by a supporter he'd never met who showed up at an obscure event eight years ago in South Carolina.\"It just goes to show you how one voice can change a room,\" Obama said - and then a city, a state and a nation. \"And if it can change a nation, it can change the world.\"\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Donald Trump inherits a much sturdier economy than the one Barack Obama carried into his second term four years ago. Back then, the scars of the Great Recession were still fresh. Joblessness was near 8 percent. Pay was flat. Europe faced a grave debt crisis that threatened to spread across the Atlantic.\n",

      "Now? The job market, with steady hiring and just 4.9 percent unemployment, has proved durable. Pay is finally accelerating. Auto sales are near a record pace. Housing is stronger. Europe's financial plight has stabilized. Yet the economy's long-standing shift toward workers with college degrees left people without them stuck with dimmer job opportunities and stagnant wages - a trend for which Trump blamed trade deals that he said led manufacturers to move overseas. The Americans who elected Trump are longing not just for change but for a reversal of the Obama era - one that will ignite growth, slash taxes, restore lost factory jobs and curb most federal regulations. Problem is, the economy's most vexing problems - from an aging workforce to listless productivity to weak corporate spending - defy quick fixes. Trump has pledged an economic renaissance yet has avoided the broad policy prescriptions widely seen as necessary for managing a government. Well before the election, Trump's supporters came to distrust government data that pointed to a recovery and to question the interventions by the Federal Reserve to sustain growth. But given his extravagant economic promises, the hotelier, real estate developer and TV celebrity faces an uphill challenge. \"His lack of governing experience, potential difficulties building relationships with congressional leaders and inconsistent policy pronouncements during the race make it hard to predict his policy initiatives or his effectiveness in driving them through Congress,\" Mark Haefele and Thomas McLoughlin of UBS wrote in a note to investors. On the positive side, economists say they see no signs of the financial excesses or stalled consumer spending that often tip economies into recession. Yet with interest rates still near record lows, the Fed has little ammunition left to help should the economy weaken. If things sour, Trump's \"policy options will be constrained, perhaps historically so,\" said Patrick O'Keefe, director of economic research at the consulting firm CohnReznick. Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, growth has averaged a subpar 2.2 percent a year. Yet at 89 months old, this is the fourth-longest of 33 recoveries from recession dating to 1858, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. The Fed has signaled it's confident enough in the economy to resume raising short-term rates at its next meeting in mid-December. Late last year, the Fed raised its benchmark short-term rate from a record low after having kept it there for seven years to help rejuvenate the economy after the recession. It had been expected to follow this year with several more rate increases. But trouble overseas - especially panic over a sharp slowdown in China, the world's No. 2 economy - and a slump in U.S. growth put the central bank on hold. The economy has also been slowed by a strong dollar, which has made U.S. goods costlier overseas. Tepid business investment, partly resulting from cuts in the energy industry in response to low oil prices, has hurt, too. In the meantime, by historical standards, borrowing rates remain extraordinarily low. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.57 percent this week, not much above the record low of 3.31 percent. Many economists think super-low rates will remain in place for years, which is why they fret that there will be little room for the Fed to cut rates further to deliver stimulus in case of a recession. J.P. Morgan pegs the probability of a recession within the next three years at 66 percent. \"The tools that in the past have been used to combat a recession or try to enhance a decelerating economy are already exhausted,\" O'Keefe says. It's possible, of course, that Trump and Congress will agree on some initiative that might help energize the economy - on infrastructure spending, for example, or tax reform. For years, the economy has been hobbled by an older and slower-growing workforce and by lackluster gains in the productivity of its workers. The percentage of adults who either have a job or are looking for one has dropped from 66 percent when the Great Recession hit in December 2007 to 62.8 percent. Retirements by the vast generation of baby boomers are part of the reason. But another factor is that many working-age Americans have been forced to the sidelines as blue-collar factory jobs have vanished. Many other people have left the workforce to go on disability. Productivity - output per hour of work - fell for three straight quarters (for the first time since 1979) before rebounding in the July-September quarter. Rising productivity is vital to raising Americans' living standards because it allows businesses to pay employees more without having to raise prices. The productivity drought is a puzzle to economists. Most had expected technology to speed efficiency. One explanation is that the heart of the economy has been shifting from manufacturing, where automation has produced big productivity gains - to services, where it hasn't. Another view is that America's deteriorating roads, ports and bridges are slowing shipping and commuting times and making the economy less efficient. \"The economic cost is huge to having all those people sitting in cars and airplane tarmacs doing nothing,\" says Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For now, assuming that hiring remains solid with unemployment around historically normal levels, even tepid economic growth should manage to keep raising worker pay over the next couple of years, Harris says. Just don't expect the economy to strengthen. Growth won't likely rise much from its current listless pace of 1.5 percent to 2 percent a year, Harris says. \"There will still be a sense of disappointment in the economy for the average person, because growth isn't going to get any better,\" he says. \"We've got to accept that 2 percent is good growth, not bad growth. That's the norm now.\"\n",

      "Only good days start with a 3:45am wake up time. Then a 4:15 Uber ride to the airport. Then an hour and a half plane ride, which happens to only be about a third full. Then an airport taxi to our destination, you know, The White House. But let’s back up here. Why exactly were we at the White House? We were there for South by South Lawn. Inspired by South by Southwest (which President Obama attended this past spring), SXSL brought together innovators, creators, and organizers working with social justice and environmental issues in an all-day festival showcasing their work. So, again, why were we there?\n",
      "Our involvement at SXSL was a collaboration of two labs on campus. Sara Hendren was invited to present her work with a+a at SXSL, and came to us folks in Return Design for exhibit design and fabrication help.  Return Design is Tim Ferguson Sauder’s lab at Olin where student designers produce commissioned work for people who help people, including non-profits and art organizations. That’s where we come in… We’re Keenan, Aaron, and Gaby, juniors and student designers at Return Design.\n",
      "At the White House gate, we were greeted by two of the SXSL organizers, as well as two Secret Service members, fully equipped with all of the tactical gear you can imagine. An adorable German shepard, most likely one command away from tearing out our windpipes, sniffed our equipment-filled bags. It turns out only Sara was on ‘the list.’ The two organizers were at the ready to tackle the situation, and quickly collected our IDs and added us to said ‘list’ via pink-cased smartphone—very official and secure.\n",
      "After around 20 minutes, the additions to the list had been processed and we were all let through the first gate. All except Keenan, that is, since his birth year was incorrectly entered as 2016. He may have a baby face, but that is a little extreme. So as the rest of the team entered the premises, Keenan had the unique opportunity to stand alone for another 20 minutes with the unflinching Secret Service men before he was reinstated to his rightful age and allowed on the lawn. The two organizers assured him and reminded him to “not lose faith in the government.” Not yet.\n",
      "Once we got in, we got right to work finalizing the booth and prepping for the press and attendees. Some kind folks from the coffee bar at the event brought us iced coffees to get us going, and soon the last of the vinyl was up, we (finally!) got a power hook-up, and we had the project prototypes arranged. \n",
      "“I hit something hard when I was putting in this stake. Is there a bunker under here?” – Jeff\n",
      "“I can neither confirm nor deny those allegations.” – the grinning Secret Service guy\n",
      "When the SXSL guests arrived, we found ourselves busily engaged in good conversation. Some attendees strolled by, while others were quick to be active in discussion with us. We were excited by how many people we somehow connected to the lab, through personal connections or otherwise. \n",
      "Although we had numerous interesting conversations with many interesting people over the course of the day, there were a few people who stood out. Adam Savage, with his film crew from Tested, stopped by and interviewed Sara. He was a super genuine guy, very engaged with the project, and was happy to take a photo with us afterwards. Valerie Jarrett, a senior advisor to President Obama, also stopped by with a large Secret Service member in tow. She was sweet and showed a nuanced interest in Sara’s work as well. Both NowThis and Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls dropped by the booth to film Sara talking about the project. The NowThis video, broadcasted live on Facebook, racked up over 100k views. Gaby got to talk to Bob Boilen, host of NPR’s All Songs Considered and the Tiny Desk Concert series, which was awesome. Bob was a cool guy, and even though he was very interested in the booth, we were unable to secure an invite to the next Tiny Desk Concert… Bummer.\n",
      "In addition to talking about our booth, we were able to see some of the other happenings at SXSL. The National Park Service booth was an interactive installation: a 14 foot diameter compass with a moveable needle. When the needle points toward a national park, the compass emits a joyful ding and displays information about all NPS-maintained land in that direction.\n",
      "While we did not get to hear many of the panel discussions (we were so busy at our booth!), we did get to see Congressman John Lewis and his powerful, emotional introduction to a panel. After the booths closed at sundown, we were able to catch the performance by The Lumineers. At one point the guitarist climbed up onto the 12-foot stack of speakers and played for a while before jumping off, guitar and all. (He was OK, don’t worry!)\n",
      "After a long, amazing day at South by South Lawn, we had a delicious picnic dinner and listened to the POTUS talk with Leonardo DiCaprio and Dr. Katharine Hayhoe about climate change. After, we lay down on blankets on the South Lawn to watch the premier of Leo’s film on climate change, Before The Flood. For those of us who had enough energy left to stay awake for the whole thing, it was an interesting film showing the destruction of climate change and calling for climate action.\n",
      "Our time at SXSL was an amazing experience. We were able to not only help design and fabricate a kick-ass booth, but we were also able to have interesting conversations with inspiring people and learn from some of the most impressive innovators, creators, and organizers.

      "Massachusetts held a special election this past June to fill the vacant Massachusetts senator position left by new Secretary of State John Kerry. Obama selected Kerry for the position after Hilary Clinton stepped down from her post at the end of January.\n",
      "This marks the second time in the past four years that a long-held senate seat was up for election. Ted Kennedy and John Kerry served as Massachusetts senators for 47 years and 28 years, respectively.\n",
      "Since Kennedy passed away in 2009, his senate seat has been well contested; he was followed briefly by interim senator Paul Kirk, then Scott Brown and finally Elizabeth Warren today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kerry’s ascension to Secretary of State meant that Massachusetts had an accelerated election cycle. The candidates started campaigning in January for the April primary. Ed Markey (Democrat) and Gabriel Gomez (Republican) were the chosen candidates for the June election; a third candidate from the Twelve Visions Party was also on the ballot.\n",
      "During these campaigns, Mo Cowan served as interim senator for Massachusetts just as Paul Kirk had for the late Kennedy.\n",
      "Massachusetts radio and TV stations created a lot of buzz around the June election. In the polls, Markey was beating Gomez only by a slim margin, unusual for such a left-leaning state. Democrats have particularly low turnout for non-major elections, which meant that both had a fighting chance of winning the elections.\n",
      "Voter turnout was just shy of 1.2 million, only a 27% turnout from the registered voters in Massachusetts.\n",
      "The results? Markey won with 54.8% of the vote, Gomez took home 44.8% and Richard Heos from Twelve Visions received 0.4%. Gomez may have lost, but he gained a high percent of the vote given that registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans three to one in Massachusetts (as of October 2012).\n",
      "Now that Markey has secured the position of senator, it will be interesting to see what he does over the next six years.\n",

    "<b>A.</b> Using the Jeopardy data from question 3, perform a logistic regression to determine whether or not a player wins the game based on either first break scores, or end of round1 scores. \n",
    "Create an ROC curve for this logistic regression and give a personal opinion (backed up by the curve and its sensitivity/recall) about how good the logistic regression is. What would you recommend as a score threshold for the best prediction as to 'whether a player will win the game or not'?\n",

    "<b>B.</b> The problem in part A is a subtle variation on a more traditional logistic regression problem. If two players both have scores of $20,000 at the end of the first round, the statistics indicate that they are both likely to win. However, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcLjcSloXs\" target=\"_blank\">there can be only one</a>. Does looking at the differences in player scores improve your ability to make a definitive statement about the game? (\"Yes that person will definitely win\" or \"It's anyone's game\")\n"
